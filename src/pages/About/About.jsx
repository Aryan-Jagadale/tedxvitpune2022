          TED is a non-profit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading.
          It started as a four-day conference in California 30 years ago,
          believing passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes,
          and lives and welcoming people from every discipline and culture
          who seek a deeper understanding of the world.

        We, here at TEDxVITPune, believe that the simplest of ideas uphold
        the ability to change the world entirely. Such captivating ideas
        encourage, inspire and hold the power to bring individuals together
        and bridge the gaps between communities.
      </p>

      <p>
        The preeminent purpose of all our events, social media campaigns,
        and community newsletters is to put together, exchange and
        brainstorm ground-breaking ideas. Ideas that originate from
        different minds, different ideologies, and paramountly, different
        beings.

        Our community forms the heart and soul of TEDx. Be it the power
        echoed by the unification of different minds, or the warmth
        experienced owing to a feeling of togetherness. With constant
        engagement all throughout the year, our local community partakes in
        novel initiatives, taken to share striking ideas.

      <p>
        Over a span of 6 editions, TEDxVITPune has truly evolved and works
        religiously towards putting forth a holistic experience, one in
        which people from all disciplines of life and culture connect and
        interact.
