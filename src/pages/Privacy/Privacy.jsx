        <span className={styles.headings_privacy}>9. TEDxVITPune website</span>
        <br />
        When transmitting Personal Information from your computer to the
        TEDxVITPune website, you must keep in mind that the transmission of
        information over the Internet is not always completely secure or
        error-free. Other than liability that cannot lawfully be excluded, we
        will not be liable in any way in relation to any breach of security or
        any unintended loss or disclosure of that information.
        <br />
        The TEDxVITPune website may use 'cookies' or other similar tracking
        technologies on our website that help us track your website usage and
        remember your preferences. Cookies are small files that store
        information on your computer, TV, mobile phone or other device. They
        enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognise you
        across different websites, services, devices and/or browsing sessions.

        <br />
        <span className={styles.headings_privacy}>10. Security</span>
        <br />
        We may hold your Personal Information in either electronic or hard
        copy. We take reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information
        from misuse, interference and loss, as well as unauthorised access,
        modification or disclosure and we use a number of physical,
        administrative, personnel and technical measures to protect your
        Personal Information. For example, we ensure data is properly secured
        at all times with only limited access by authorised personnel and
        representatives.
        <br />
        However, we cannot guarantee the security of any Personal Information
        transmitted over the internet and therefore you disclose information
        to us at your own risk. We will not be liable for any unauthorised
        access, modification or disclosure, or misuse of your Personal
        Information.
