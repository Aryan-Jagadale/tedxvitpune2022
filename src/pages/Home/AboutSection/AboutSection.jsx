              TED is a nonprofit organisation devoted to spreading ideas,
              usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less).
              TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment,
              and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics from
              science and business to global issues, in more than a 100
              languages.
